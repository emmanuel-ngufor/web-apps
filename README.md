Welcome to my **Web-Apps** repository! This repository contains all my personal web development projects as I work towards becoming a Full Stack Developer. I am learning and applying various technologies such as **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, **Node.js** (MERN stack), along with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, and more.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress as I develop web applications, ranging from simple front-end projects to more complex full-stack applications. This includes building interactive UIs, handling back-end logic, managing databases, and integrating various tools and libraries.

I aim to become proficient in both front-end and back-end development, and this repository reflects my journey and learning.

## Projects

Here are a few types of projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **CRUD Applications** – Web apps where users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
2. **Blog Websites** – Simple blog platforms built using Node.js, Express, and EJS for templating.
3. **To-Do List Apps** – Task management apps with full back-end integration.
4. **APIs** – RESTful APIs to interact with data from various sources.
5. **React Apps** – Interactive front-end applications built with React.js.
6. **MongoDB Integration** – Applications that involve data persistence using MongoDB.

Each project is located in its own folder with a brief description and relevant code.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end:
- **HTML5** – For structuring web pages
- **CSS3** – For styling web pages (including frameworks like Bootstrap)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For adding interactivity and dynamic content
- **React.js** – For building UI components
- **jQuery** – For simpler DOM manipulation and AJAX

### Back-end:
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for back-end logic
- **Express.js** – For routing and handling HTTP requests
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing data
- **Mongoose** – ORM for MongoDB
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)** – For rendering dynamic content in the UI

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Git** – Version control system for tracking changes
- **npm** – Package manager to handle project dependencies
- **Bootstrap** – CSS framework for responsive design
